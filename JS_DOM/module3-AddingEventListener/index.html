<!-- This is just an example how to create a html and use it for event listener in JS 
     To add event listener get the attibute either by id or by using querySelector
     then we can perform eventListener operation on that attribute.
     eventListener has two parameters: ("which event we want to perform"), ("function()-> to change text/color")
