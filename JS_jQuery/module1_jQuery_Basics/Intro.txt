What is jQuery and Why we are using it ?
- jQuery is a Javascript library
- It is just a large single .js file that has many pre-built methods and objects that simplify your workflow
- Specifically interacting with the DOM and making HTTP requests (AJAX).
- Earlier we are using DOM where we are using "document.getElementById();" and "document.querySelector".

// The difference between jQuery and DOM is:

Ex:
//jQuery
var divs = $('div');

//DOM
var divs = document.querySelectorAll('div');
